## GitHub Pages
Quartz is designed to be effortless to deploy. If you forked and cloned Quartz directly from the repository, everything should already be good to go! Follow the steps below.

### Enable GitHub Actions
By default, GitHub disables workflows from running automatically on Forked Repostories. Head to the 'Actions' tab of your forked repository and Enable Workflows to setup deploying your Quartz site!

### Enable GitHub Pages

Head to the 'Settings' tab of your forked repository and go to the 'Pages' tab.

1. (IMPORTANT) Set the source to deploy from `master` using `/ (root)`
2. Set a custom domain here if you have one!

### Pushing Changes
To see your changes on the internet, we need to push it them to GitHub. Quartz is essentially a `git` repository so updating it is the same workflow as you would follow as normal.

```shell
# Navigate to Quartz folder
cd <path-to-quartz>

# Commit all changes
git add .
git commit -m "message describing changes"

# Push to GitHub to update site
git push origin hugo
```

Note: we specifically push to the `hugo` branch here. Our GitHub action automatically runs everytime a push to is detected to that branch and then updates the `master` branch for redeployment.

### Setting up the Site
Now let's get this site up and running. Never hosted a site before? No problem. Have a fancy custom domain you already own or want to subdomain your Quartz? That's easy too.

Here, we take advantage of GitHub's free page hosting to deploy our site. Change `baseURL` in `/config.toml`.

[Reference `config.toml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/config.toml)

```toml
baseURL = "https://<YOUR-DOMAIN>/"
```

If you are using this under a subdomain (e.g. `<YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME>.github.io/quartz`), include the trailing path.

```toml
baseURL = "https://<YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME>.github.io/quartz/"
```

Change `cname` in `/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml`. Again, if you don't have a custom domain to use, you can use `<YOUR-USERNAME>.github.io`.

[Reference `deploy.yaml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml)

```yaml
- name: Deploy  
  uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3  
  with:  
	github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # this can stay as is, GitHub fills this in for us!
	publish_dir: ./public  
	publish_branch: master
	cname: <YOUR-DOMAIN>
```

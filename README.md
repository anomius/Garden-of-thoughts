What’s got awesome weed and memes that aren’t funny plus a bag of chips? Huh? Well, my digital page on the internet of course! You see fellows, I am no good at gardening. I once almost killed my house plant (it lived though) with weed killer. And I never even got high off the stuff. But my bro told me there was something out there that will give you the profits of growing a dope crop in the comfort of your home. So I decided to make my own Plant to sell on the streets. And you can buy one on this website…
free.
